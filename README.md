# About
ZeesHUD is a TF2 custom HUD made by TF2 Community member and YTuber, Zeesastrous (or Zeesa, for short.) The HUD itslef is unlike any other HUD that can be found in HUD.TF at the time, instead of minimalist features that typically found in other custom HUDs, ZeesHUD was more focussed on bringing style and asthetic into its presentation, making the HUD look more pretty while not being too eye-catchy. I tried it myself, and I fell in love with how stylish and full of life it is. And I still use it today over all of the custom HUDs there are in HUDs.TF.

The unfortunate part is, however. the fact that there are a lot of people in the TF2 Community that seem to draw lot of ire against Zeesa. which fully escalated with something that happened in Zeesa's past (I won't explain it here, just for the sake of time. but you may be able to find a thread about it on Twitter if you do you're on research.) to which Zeesa had to delete all of his videos, and wipe a good majority of his social media posts. At this point, Zeesa couldn't handle it anymore and decided to leave the internet all together, deleting any videos he had on his Youtube Channel and deleting his twiiter account. 

This fork is dedicated to the hard work that Zessa has made to make a HUD that was vastly different from the others and I hope I can be of service if any parts of the HUD breaks.
